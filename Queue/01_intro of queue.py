What is Queue ?

= A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order
in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).
 A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first. 
 The difference between stacks and queues is in removing. In a stack we remove the item the most recently added; in a queue,
  we remove the item the least recently added.


Enqueue= The prosess of adding the element in queue is called enqueue..

Dequeue= The prosess of removing the element in queue is called dequeue..

Most important operation of queue=1) enqueue
                                  2) dequeue
                                  3) isfull
                                  4) isempty

Used of Queue= Serving requests on a single shared resource, like a printer,
              CPU task scheduling etc. In real life scenario, Call Center phone systems
              uses Queues to hold people calling them in an order, until a service representative
              is free. Handling of interrupts in real-time systems.
